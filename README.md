<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [Catlog] <a name="about-project"></a>

> In this project, we have created a console app that will help you to keep a record of different types of things you own: books, music albums, movies, and games. Everything will be based on the UML class diagram presented below. The data will be stored in JSON files but we also prepare a database with tables structure analogical to your program's class structure.
